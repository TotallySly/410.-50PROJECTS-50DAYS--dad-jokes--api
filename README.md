## 410.- 50 Projects 50 Days - Dad Jokes (API)

### What was the project about?

The project is part of the 50 Projects in 50 Days with Brad Travesy via Udemy. The course is a code-a-long to further cement skills used within HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

This project was to showcase how to use APIs for a webpage. The 'Dad jokes' are from an API on the website [icanhazdadjoke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api). Every time a user refreshes the page, or clicks 'Get Another Joke', a fetch request is made to the '_icanhazdadjoke_ website, which in turn generates a new random joke.

#### CSS

The project used very basic CSS, again of which nothing new was really learnt or enhanced.

#### JavaScript

In terms of the amount of JavaScript used, this did not require a lot of lines of code. However, this is the first ever instance I have used an API and various JavaScript methods, such as `fetch` `await` `sync`, and `.then`

These subjects are something I need to learn about, but I have added this to an important section of things to learn for the futur. I feel that they are rather indepth and complex subjects that require more time to really delve into.
